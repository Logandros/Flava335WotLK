# Transmogrification

#### About
Transmogrification allows you to change the display of an item to something else.
The appearance of items you collect is automatically stored for use on your account.
Requirements can be tweaked in the server configuration file.
Any item should work with transmogrification. Custom items as well. No item is hardcoded to the system.
Has a feature to store sets of displays. This can be removed before compiling or in the configuration file.
Made for 3.3.5a.<br />
